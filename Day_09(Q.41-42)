### Q41. 
Please write a query to return the total number of customers who didn't rent any movies in May 2007. 
(Hint: You can use NOT IN to exclude customers who have rented movies in May 2020.)

-- solution 1
SELECT count(*)
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
	SELECT customer_id 
	FROM rental 
	WHERE date(rental_date) >= '2007-05-01'
	AND   date(rental_date) <= '2007-05-31'
);

-- solution 2
WITH cte7 AS (
	SELECT customer_id, count(*) AS rent_customer
	FROM rental 
	WHERE date(rental_date) BETWEEN '2007-05-01' AND '2007-05-31'
	GROUP BY customer_id 
)
SELECT count(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM customer 
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
	SELECT customer_id 
	FROM cte7
);




### Q42. 
Please write a query to return the titles of the films that have not been returned by our customers. 
(Hint: If a movie is not returned, the return_date will be NULL in the rental table.)


-- solution
WITH not_return AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT film_id 
	FROM inventory 
	WHERE inventory_id IN (
		SELECT inventory_id
		FROM rental 
		WHERE return_date IS NULL 
		)
)
SELECT title 
FROM film 
WHERE film_id IN (
	SELECT film_id 
	FROM not_return 
);
