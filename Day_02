### Q1. Please write a query to return the name of the store and its manager, that generated the most sales.

-- solution 1
SELECT store, manager
FROM SALES_BY_STORE SBS 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
LIMIT 1;
-- In solution 1, store and manager were selected from the sales_by_store table.
-- After organizing descending order, only one was extracted using limit.

-- solution 2
SELECT store, manager
FROM SALES_BY_STORE SBS 
WHERE total_sales IN (
	SELECT max(TOTAL_SALES) 
	FROM SALES_BY_STORE 
);
-- In solution 2, store and manageer are selected from the sales_by_store Table.
-- In the where clause, I created a subquery to extract the store and manager with the
-- highest total_sales using max.



### Q2. Please write a query to find the top 3 film categories that generated the most sales. The order of your results does not matter.

-- solution 1
SELECT category 
FROM SALES_BY_FILM_CATEGORY SBFC 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
LIMIT 3;
-- In solution 1, category is selected from sales_by_film_category Table.
-- After organizing descending order, three category are extracted using limit.


-- solution 2
WITH cte1 AS (
	SELECT category
	FROM SALES_BY_FILM_CATEGORY SBFC 
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
)
SELECT category 
FROM cte1 
LIMIT 3;
-- In solution 2, I made cte1 Table extracted category organizing descending order. 
-- After that, I selected three categories from cte1 Table.


-- solution 3
SELECT category 
FROM SALES_BY_FILM_CATEGORY SBFC 
WHERE total_sales IN (
	SELECT total_sales 
	FROM SALES_BY_FILM_CATEGORY 
	ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
) 
LIMIT 3; 
-- In solution 3, category is selected from sales_by_film_category Table.
-- In the where clause, I created subquery that can extract total_sales columns descending order. 
-- And then, I tried to extract three categories using limit.
